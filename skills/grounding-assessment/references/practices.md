Grounded Leadership in Action: How Being
Grounded (or Ungrounded) Impacts Work and
Career
Introduction: Grounding in a professional context refers to a state of being  balanced, self-aware, and
present. A grounded leader or professional has a solid sense of self, remains calm under pressure, and
makes decisions aligned with their values and long-term goals. In contrast, an ungrounded individual may
feel scattered, reactive, and easily overwhelmed by circumstances. These differences affect everything from
major strategic business decisions (such as timing a new initiative, managing risks, fostering innovation,
or handling layoffs) to significant career moves (like deciding whether to change roles, quit a job, stay the
course, or pivot in a new direction) and even daily work habits (how one manages attention, email, energy,
and reactions throughout the day). The following sections explore nine key areas of work and leadership,
illustrating what grounded behavior looks like versus ungrounded patterns. Each section discusses the
impact on business and career, and offers expert-informed practices and vivid examples to demonstrate
how grounding (or lack thereof) plays out in real scenarios.
Team Interaction & Collaboration
Grounded Behaviors:
- Listens actively and attentively to team members, giving others full presence without distractions.
- Maintains a calm, respectful tone  even under stress, responding thoughtfully rather than reacting
harshly.
-  Encourages  open  dialogue  and  welcomes  diverse  perspectives  or  feedback,  creating  an  inclusive
atmosphere.
- Shows empathy and consistency in interactions, which builds trust and psychological safety on the team.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
-  Frequently  interrupts  or  appears  distracted  (e.g.  checking  phone  or  multitasking)  when  others  are
speaking, signaling disinterest.
- Reacts impulsively in meetings – possibly raising their voice, dismissing ideas out of hand, or becoming
defensive when challenged.
- Dominates conversations or, conversely, withdraws and becomes uncommunicative without explanation,
making team dynamics unpredictable.
-  Lets  ego  or  anxiety  drive  the  interaction  (for  instance,  taking  credit  unfairly  or  micromanaging
discussions), which erodes trust and morale.
Impact:
- Business/Team: Grounded leaders cultivate high-trust, collaborative teams. Team members feel safe to
share  ideas  and  concerns,  which  boosts  innovation,  problem-solving,  and  overall  team  performance.
Ungrounded interactions, on the other hand, can create fear, confusion, or resentment in a team. A tense
team that anticipates outbursts or indifference from their leader is less productive and may withhold ideas
1


or feedback, hurting project outcomes.
- Career: A professional known for steady, supportive team leadership tends to gain respect, loyalty, and
positive recognition – often leading to promotion opportunities and a strong reputation. In contrast,
someone with a volatile or inattentive interpersonal style may find their career stalled; they might be
bypassed for leadership roles if colleagues and superiors see them as difficult to work with or lacking
people skills.
- Daily Execution: Day-to-day, grounded collaboration means meetings that run smoothly with constructive
dialogue and quick conflict resolution. Team members know what to expect from their leader’s demeanor.
Ungrounded behavior leads to daily friction – meetings veer off-track due to emotional outbursts or poor
listening, minor issues balloon into drama, and time is wasted managing interpersonal fallouts rather than
achieving goals.
Practices & Tips:
-  Practice active listening and empathy: Make a habit of paraphrasing what you heard and asking
questions before responding. Leadership experts (like Brené Brown) emphasize that vulnerability and
curiosity in conversations strengthen trust – for example, admitting “I might be missing something, can you
tell me more?” shows grounded confidence rather than defensiveness.
-  Center  yourself  before  interactions: Take  a  moment  to  breathe  deeply  and  set  an  intention  for
important meetings or tough conversations. Some CEOs do a brief mindfulness pause at the start of a
meeting. This kind of somatic grounding (feeling your feet on the floor, steadying your breath) helps you
carry a calm presence that will “signal safety” to the team.
- Encourage input and acknowledge contributions: Grounded leaders routinely invite team members to
speak and genuinely consider their input. Even when you must make a final call, acknowledging others
(“These are great ideas — thank you, everyone. Here’s what we’ll do…”) shows you value them. This behavior,
advocated by organizational psychologists for building psychological safety, leads to more engaged and
innovative teams.
-  Develop  emotional  intelligence  with  support: Consider  working  with  a  coach  or  mentor  on
communication and emotional regulation skills. They can provide feedback on blind spots — maybe you
don’t realize you cut people off or that your tone sounds harsher under stress. With practice (and perhaps
role-playing difficult scenarios), you can learn to respond in a steady, constructive way even when tensions
run high.
Example: Imagine a team meeting where an unexpected problem is being discussed. A grounded manager
notices she’s feeling anxious about the bad news but consciously takes a slow breath and remains attentive.
She listens as each team member speaks, asks clarifying questions, and nods to show understanding. Even
if she disagrees with an idea, she responds with respect: “I see why you suggest that. Let’s explore it
further.” Her calm, present demeanor helps the group stay in problem-solving mode, and together they find
a solution. In contrast, an ungrounded manager facing the same issue might cut people off—“No, that won’t
work!”—and let frustration seep into her voice. She might fiddle with her phone or furrow her brow angrily
while others talk. The team picks up on her tension and either falls silent or starts arguing. Ultimately, little
gets resolved in the meeting, and the team leaves demoralized and hesitant to speak up next time. The
difference illustrates how a leader’s grounded presence can transform collaboration, whereas ungrounded
behavior can derail it.

Digital Communication & Notifications
Grounded Behaviors:
- Manages digital channels  mindfully: for example, checks and replies to email or messaging apps at
designated times instead of constantly reacting to every ping. This disciplined approach prevents distraction
and information overload.
- Crafts thoughtful, measured responses to emails and messages. Even when urgency is high, a grounded
professional takes a moment to compose themselves so the tone remains clear and respectful (never firing
off an emotional rant).
- Sets clear boundaries for digital availability. They might turn off non-essential notifications during deep
work, refrain from late-night non-urgent emails, and communicate to their team when they are offline.
- Models healthy digital habits: encouraging a culture where taking time to respond is okay if it means a
better answer. For instance, they might use statuses like “In Focus Mode – will respond in 2 hours” to signal
that they are concentrating on high-priority work, thereby normalizing focus time for everyone.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Always on edge with notifications: Immediately grabs the phone or opens emails with every chime, even
in the middle of focused tasks or conversations, leading to constant task-switching. This person feels
controlled by the inbox and Slack, rather than in control of their attention.
- Sends messages at all hours (late nights, weekends) and expects instant replies, implicitly pressuring
everyone to be constantly available. This lack of boundary can create a frantic, burnout-inducing pace for
the whole team.
- Frequently dashes off hasty emails or chat messages in reaction to stress — for example, firing off an
angry email when something goes wrong, or replying “OK fine” to a complex request without fully reading
it. These impulsive communications often cause confusion or conflict that then must be cleaned up later.
- Over-communicates in a disorganized way: spamming people with information on multiple channels,
CC’ing everyone unnecessarily, or not filtering content. Team members may get overwhelmed by the
volume of messages and start tuning out, which means important info can get lost.
Impact:
- Business/Team: Grounded digital communication creates a calmer, more focused working environment.
When a leader or team member sets a tone of thoughtful responses and reasonable availability, it reduces
stress and allows others to concentrate on their work without fear of missing out or being criticized for not
replying instantly. Over time, this improves productivity and prevents burnout. By contrast, an ungrounded
“always-on” communication style can spread anxiety through the team. Employees may feel they have to
check messages 24/7, leading to distraction, mistakes, and high stress. Important decisions might be made
hastily over email or chat without proper deliberation, hurting business outcomes. Moreover, constant
interruption culture means deeper strategic work gets fragmented or delayed, impacting the organization’s
overall performance.
- Career: Professionals who communicate in a balanced, thoughtful way tend to earn a reputation for being
organized, reliable, and respectful. For example, an executive who consistently provides clear email updates
and doesn’t bombard others with last-minute requests is seen as someone who has things under control —
a sign of leadership potential. In contrast, if you’re known as the person who sends frantic midnight emails
full of half-baked thoughts, or who can’t be away from your phone for a second, colleagues might perceive
you  as  disorganized  or  overly  reactive.  That  can  hurt  your  chances  of  advancement  into  higher-
responsibility roles. Superiors might worry that you’d overwhelm your team or buckle under pressure if
given more authority.

- Daily Execution: On a daily level, a grounded approach to digital tools means you allocate specific times
to handle communications and can devote the rest of your day to focused execution of tasks. This leads to a
sense of control and accomplishment — you respond to messages in batches and spend other blocks of
time making real progress on projects. You’re less drained because you’re not mentally multitasking all day.
An ungrounded approach means your day is constantly chopped into tiny fragments by pings and dings.
You might start drafting a report, but then three emails arrive and you jump to those, then a chat message
sidetracks you, and an hour later the report is forgotten. By evening, you’ve been “busy” all day but
important work remains unfinished. This scattershot pattern is exhausting and creates a vicious cycle of
feeling behind, prompting even more after-hours emailing to catch up.
Practices & Tips:
- Batch your notifications: Productivity experts recommend techniques like checking email at set intervals
(say 2-3 times a day) instead of continuously. You can close your email app or silence notifications during
focus periods. Some leaders even have “email office hours.” This may feel uncomfortable at first if you’re
used to instant replies, but it trains others to respect your response times and it trains you to concentrate
better.
-  Pause before you send: If you feel emotional about an email (frustrated, angry, anxious), draft it in a
document first or wait 5 minutes before hitting send. Often, taking a few deep breaths or rereading your
message will lead you to soften a harsh wording or catch an error. This mindful emailing practice prevents a
lot of digital fires.
- Set communication norms with your team: For instance, agree that after 7pm or on weekends, emails
will be labeled “Urgent” only if they truly are (and otherwise can wait). Encourage use of status indicators
(“Out for lunch,” “In a meeting”) so people know why you might not respond immediately. As a leader,
explicitly telling your team “It’s okay not to answer after hours; I just schedule emails when I think of them,
but I don’t expect a reply at night” can remove fear. Ultimately, modeling this behavior yourself is key — if
you never take a digital break, your team won’t feel safe to, either.
- Leverage tools to assist focus: If self-discipline is hard, use tech to help. For example, many phones and
laptops have “Do Not Disturb” modes or apps that batch notifications. Even using a simple technique like
turning off the email push on your phone (so you only see new emails when you manually refresh) can be
liberating. Some executives also do a “digital detox” mini-session—like no email every day during lunch, or a
full day offline on a weekend—to reset. Coaches often suggest experimenting to find a balance that
reclaims your attention.
Example: Consider two project managers, Alice and Ben, during a normal workday. Alice, who is grounded
in her digital habits, starts her morning by reviewing her top priorities. She leaves her email closed for the
first hour while she works on a key project deliverable. When that hour is up, she spends 20 minutes going
through emails in batches, responding thoughtfully where needed. During the afternoon, she schedules
two short windows to check communications again. If a notification pops up outside those windows, she
gauges urgency: a critical client issue might warrant breaking her rule, but routine messages can wait. She
also communicates her schedule to her team (e.g., “I’ll be offline for a couple of hours to focus on X, but will
check messages at 3pm”). Ben, who is ungrounded, wakes up and immediately scrolls through a flurry of
emails on his phone before he’s even out of bed. At the office, he has his email and chat apps open all the
time, with banners and pings constantly interrupting him. As he tries to draft a client proposal, he stops
every few minutes to answer trivial emails or acknowledge every new Slack message with an emoji. He also
sends out requests the moment they occur to him — five separate emails to his team throughout the day as
new ideas pop up, none of which were truly urgent or consolidated. By 9pm, Alice has accomplished the
majority of her critical tasks and feels in control; she’s offline having dinner, trusting that anything truly
4


urgent will call her phone. Ben, however, is exhausted and still tethered to his laptop late into the night,
catching up on the proposal he never finished due to constant interruptions. His team, having received
messages from him at all hours, feel the pressure to also be online and responsive late into the evening.
This example shows how a grounded approach to digital communication yields better results and well-
being, whereas an ungrounded approach leads to stress and inefficiency.
Task Focus & Execution
Grounded Behaviors:
- Prioritizes important tasks and gives full attention to the task at hand. A grounded worker often practices
“deep work,” focusing on one thing in a sustained way rather than fragmenting their attention.
- Remains present and engaged in current activities. They notice when their mind starts to wander and
gently bring focus back, which leads to higher quality output and fewer mistakes.
- Organizes their day intentionally, perhaps grouping similar tasks or scheduling blocks of time for critical
work. They protect these focus times from interruption (for example, by closing the office door or putting
the phone on silent) because they know concentration is valuable.
- Recognizes and manages distractions proactively. For instance, a grounded habit might be to clear one’s
desk of clutter, or use a checklist to stay on track, or practice a quick mindfulness exercise to reset if they
feel attention slipping.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Chronic multitasking: Tries to juggle many tasks at once — writing a report while answering messages
and sitting in on a call — leading to partial attention on each and frequent context-switching. This can give
the illusion of productivity but generally slows progress.
- Easily distracted by external stimuli or minor tasks. An ungrounded person might start their day intending
to work on a big project, but then a non-urgent email leads them down a rabbit hole, or they keep jumping
whenever a notification or a colleague interrupts them, never returning to the original priority.
- Procrastinates on challenging or important work by doing “busywork” instead. Feelings of anxiety or
overwhelm may drive them to tackle a dozen small, easy tasks (or scroll social media) rather than the one
crucial task that would have real impact. As a result, deadlines creep up suddenly, causing last-minute
panic.
- Often equates busyness with effectiveness, filling their calendar and task list to the brim. They may brag
about multitasking or long hours, but in truth much of that time is spent in frantic switching and rework
because deep focus was never achieved.
Impact:
- Business/Team: Grounded execution means that projects are completed with care and on time. When a
leader or team member is focused, they catch errors before they become big problems, they produce
creative solutions (since creativity often requires uninterrupted thought), and they model good work habits
for others. A team full of focused individuals will outperform one where everyone is scatterbrained. On the
flip side, ungrounded work habits can diminish a team’s effectiveness. Important tasks slip through the
cracks or are rushed at the last minute. Quality suffers — for example, a report written in a hurry between
meetings might contain inaccuracies. If a leader is the one who’s unfocused, they may inadvertently derail
others by constantly shifting directions or interrupting for trivial matters, reducing overall productivity and
causing frustration.
-  Career: People who are known to  get things done reliably and with high quality tend to advance. A
grounded  professional,  by  consistently  executing  well  on  their  responsibilities,  earns  a  reputation  as
5


dependable and competent. They also likely produce standout work (innovative ideas, well-thought-out
strategies) because they dedicate proper time to thinking things through — a trait highly valued in senior
roles. In contrast, someone who is always busy but frequently delivers subpar or incomplete results will
struggle to move up. Their managers and peers might see them as unreliable or scattered. Even if they are
talented, the lack of focus can translate to missed promotions or being passed over for leading big projects,
since higher-ups need to trust that important initiatives will be seen through to completion.
- Daily Execution: On a daily basis, being grounded in task focus leads to a satisfying sense of progress.
You might finish the day having completed two or three key items that truly matter, which provides a feeling
of accomplishment and reduces stress. You’re less likely to end up working late to catch up on what you
“couldn’t get to.” In contrast, ungrounded days often end with a pile of half-done tasks and the uneasy
feeling of “I was busy all day, but what did I actually accomplish?” This can lead to working into the night or
just a constant sense of anxiety. Over time, that daily stress accumulates, possibly leading to burnout or a
habit of continually firefighting because important work was not handled in a timely way.
Practices & Tips:
- Time blocking and single-tasking: Try blocking off specific periods (e.g., 9–11am) dedicated to a single
high-priority task, and treat that time as you would an important meeting (no interruptions allowed). During
that block, close unrelated tabs/apps. Productivity coaches often suggest the Pomodoro technique as well:
work with deep focus for 25-minute intervals followed by a 5-minute break. This trains concentration
stamina. Find a rhythm that works for you – some people prefer longer blocks for complex work.
- Prioritize with a daily plan: Start each day by identifying 1-3 most important tasks that align with your
goals. Write them down. Grounded execution comes from clarity. If you hit a distraction or a request, check
it  against  your  priorities.  If  it’s  not  truly  urgent  or  important,  consciously  decide  to  address  it  later.
Techniques from books like “Deep Work” by Cal Newport or classic advice from Peter Drucker underscore
that doing fewer things well is more effective than doing many things poorly.
-  Reduce digital distractions: We touched on this in the digital communication section – apply those
principles here strictly during focus times. That might mean closing email, putting your phone in another
room, or using site-blocker apps to avoid the lure of social media during work sessions. Consider an
environment tweak: if open-office noise or constant chat messages disrupt you, find a quiet room or use
noise-cancelling headphones when you need to concentrate.
- Mindfulness for micro-focus: If your mind is scattered, a quick mindfulness technique can help re-center
you. For example, take 1 minute to practice breathing deeply and then calmly re-state to yourself what you
are about to work on (“Now I will spend the next hour writing the project brief. Other things can wait.”). This
self-cueing reduces anxiety about everything else and grounds you in the present task. Over time, such
practice strengthens your overall attention span. Some leaders even treat these mini-refocus moments as a
mental “reset” button throughout the day.
Example: Picture two analysts working on a critical report. Analyst A, who is grounded, starts by outlining
the report’s key sections and then dives into writing, one section at a time. He puts his phone on do-not-
disturb and lets coworkers know he’ll be unavailable for the next two hours to concentrate. When he notices
his mind wandering or the temptation to check email, he gently steers his attention back to the outline. By
midday, he’s completed a solid draft. After lunch, he reviews emails and handles a couple of quick queries,
then returns to polish data analysis for the report with fresh eyes. He ends the day having finished the
report draft and even had time for a short review, ensuring quality. Analyst B, who is ungrounded, has a
very different day. She starts working on the same report but quickly gets sidetracked when an email from
her boss arrives; she stops writing to answer it immediately. While in her inbox, she sees a calendar invite
and a couple of FYI emails and spends 30 minutes tidying those up. Back to the report — she’s lost her
6


place, and soon a chat message comes in asking for minor help on another project. She thinks, “It’ll just
take a few minutes,” and jumps on that, which turns into an hour. All day, Analyst B alternates between bits
of the report and various incoming tasks or messages. By 6pm, the report is only half-done, but she’s
mentally exhausted. She now faces an evening of catching up to meet the deadline. In this scenario, Analyst
A’s focused strategy not only produced better work in less time, but also left him less stressed. Analyst B’s
well-intentioned  responsiveness  and  multitasking  resulted  in  inefficiency  and  a  longer  workday.  This
example highlights how grounded task execution wins out in both productivity and personal well-being.
Prioritization & Strategic Alignment
Grounded Behaviors:
- Clearly defines long-term  priorities based on core goals and values, and uses them as a guide when
allocating time or making decisions. A grounded leader frequently asks, “Does this serve our mission or
vision?” before committing resources.
- Takes a big-picture perspective before acting. Rather than rushing, they will step back to see how different
pieces fit together. This might involve strategic planning sessions, consulting the data, or listening to
intuition, but always with an eye on overall alignment.
- Balances analysis with intuition on major decisions. They don’t ignore gut feelings (for example, a sense
that the timing isn’t right for an expansion) — instead, they investigate those hunches alongside facts. This
prevents them from being purely reactive to external pressure or hype.
- Is willing to say no or not now to opportunities that look exciting but don’t align with the current strategy
or capacity. Grounded professionals have a certain discipline to resist shiny-object syndrome; they’d rather
do a few things well that fit the strategy than overextend in all directions.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Constantly changes priorities or has a moving target. One week the focus is on one project, next week it’s
abandoned for a new idea, often without clear rationale. This whiplash effect usually comes from chasing
trends or getting anxious about missing out.
- Makes strategic decisions driven by short-term emotions or external noise. For example, an ungrounded
exec might impulsively decide to restructure the team because a competitor did so, or launch a product
prematurely because investors are pressuring, without proper preparation or alignment to a real strategy.
- Struggles to articulate what the priorities even are. Everything seems equally urgent to them, which
effectively means  nothing is truly prioritized. This can leave their team confused and working at cross-
purposes, since there’s no clear north star.
- Neglects reflection or learning from past outcomes. Ungrounded behavior might include jumping from
task to task and firefighting daily issues with no pause to consider if those tasks align to strategic goals.
They’re always too busy to recalibrate, so they drift off course over time.
Impact:
-  Business/Team: Grounded prioritization and alignment ensure that the organization’s resources (time,
money, talent) are directed toward what truly matters. Teams under such leadership understand the “why”
behind their work and see how their tasks contribute to a larger goal, which boosts motivation and
coherence. When tough calls arise (like cutting a project or delaying a launch), a grounded leader makes
them in service of the strategy, often explaining the reasoning to maintain trust. The result is typically
better performance and agility — the company can focus its efforts effectively and adapt without losing its
core direction. By contrast, ungrounded leadership can waste tremendous resources: pursuing too many
projects at once, frequently pivoting without learning, or sticking with approaches that no longer fit just
7


because of inertia. Employees may feel whiplash or disillusionment (“Why are we doing this now? We never
finish anything!”). Strategic drift or constant U-turns can cause missed market opportunities, poor customer
experiences, and internal burnout as people chase an ever-changing priority list.
- Career: A leader or professional known for strategic clarity is often entrusted with more significant roles.
For example, if you consistently demonstrate that you can align a team’s work to top business objectives
and avoid distractions, higher management will see you as someone who “gets it” — someone who can be
given bigger budgets or broader responsibility. Moreover, being grounded in your own career priorities
means you’re more likely to pursue roles and projects that actually advance your goals, rather than getting
sidetracked. Conversely, a reputation for being scattershot or reactive can hold you back. If your projects
frequently fail due to lack of direction, or if your strategy memos are all over the place, decision-makers
may lose confidence in your leadership. On a personal career decision level, being ungrounded might lead
you to hop between jobs or roles without a clear development path (chasing salary bumps or trends rather
than a coherent trajectory), which can make your experience seem unfocused.
- Daily Execution: Grounded prioritization translates to less daily stress and more meaningful progress. You
start the day knowing what the top priorities are, so you can tackle important tasks first and not agonize
over every minor choice. This doesn’t mean you won’t handle urgent issues that come up, but you’ll do so
consciously, knowing what can be deferred. People often report that having clear priorities reduces decision
fatigue. In contrast, an ungrounded approach means spending a lot of mental energy figuring out what to
do next, or constantly reacting to whoever shouted last. It’s the classic scenario of being extremely busy but
at day’s end realizing the big things weren’t addressed. That can be demoralizing. Over days and weeks, it
also means important strategic work (like planning, learning, innovating) gets squeezed out by the tyranny
of the urgent or the lure of the trivial.
Practices & Tips:
- Define your “North Star”: Take time to identify your core mission, whether personal or for your team/
organization. Leadership experts like Bill George stress the importance of knowing your True North (your
deeply held values and purpose). Write down a simple mission statement or a few key strategic goals. For
personal career alignment, you might list what success looks like for you in 5-10 years. For a team, clarify
how your team’s work supports the company’s mission. Having this written and visible (even pinned above
your desk) serves as a constant grounding reference when new opportunities or crises arise.
-  Use prioritization frameworks: A practical method is the Eisenhower Matrix (categorizing tasks into
urgent vs. important). Grounded leaders focus on what’s important (especially long-term important) even if
it’s not urgent yet, rather than just reacting to urgent noise. Another tip is to identify the top three priorities
for the week and top three for the day, and communicate those to your team or boss. This not only keeps
you aligned, but also manages expectations with others about your focus. Tools and frameworks can
prevent you from over-committing.
- Schedule strategic reflection: It sounds counterintuitive in a busy schedule, but actually block time (say
an hour a week or a day per quarter) to step back and review whether your activities are aligned with your
big goals. Many effective leaders use weekly reviews to adjust their to-do lists and a quarterly offsite (even if
solo) to check strategic progress. In these reflections, ask: “What tasks or projects this week contributed
most to our goals? What didn’t? What do I need to change going forward?” This habit prevents the gradual
drift that happens when we’re too “in the weeds.”
- Consult mentors or data for big decisions: When facing a major strategic decision (like entering a new
market, or personally deciding whether to pursue an MBA or change jobs), a grounded approach is to
gather perspective. Talk to a mentor, coach, or trusted colleague who can provide a reality check or share
experiences. Also, look at data and evidence where possible (market research, personal pros/cons lists, etc.).
This practice injects some objectivity and can curb impulsive moves. It’s not about paralysis by analysis; it’s
8


about informing your intuition with insight. Top business strategists pair intuition with evidence – you might
feel strongly about a direction, but validating that feeling with a bit of research or external input keeps you
honest and focused.
Example: Suppose a tech startup is deciding whether to pivot its product direction. Grounded scenario:
The CEO gathers her leadership team for a strategic review. They revisit the company’s vision (“What do we
ultimately want to solve for customers?”) and core competencies. They examine market data and also
discuss their gut feelings about recent customer feedback. The CEO listens to different viewpoints. Perhaps
the data shows that a new trend is worth exploring, but a grounded decision might be: pursue it in a small
pilot while continuing to strengthen the core product, rather than a full gut-rehab of the roadmap. She
communicates to the whole company why they are focusing on improving the current product for the next
six months (aligning with the long-term mission and the pilot results), so everyone understands the priority.
Ungrounded scenario: Another CEO hears that a competitor is launching something in a new space and,
feeling pressure, immediately orders her team via an all-hands meeting to “shift everything to catch up!”
There’s little analysis or discussion of whether this aligns with their unique mission. Over the next month,
teams scramble to change direction, many ongoing projects are dropped (demoralizing those teams), and
resources are thinly spread. A month later, that CEO might change her mind again if results don’t come
instantly,  causing  even  more  confusion.  In  this  ungrounded  approach,  the  lack  of  steady  strategic
alignment leads to wasted effort and a disoriented workforce. In the grounded approach, decisions are
deliberate and aligned with a clear strategy, so even when adjusting course, it’s done with purpose and the
team stays cohesive.
Workload & Boundaries
Grounded Behaviors:
- Sets realistic boundaries for work hours and workload. A grounded professional knows their limits and
respects them — for example, striving to be fully present during work, but then disconnecting in the
evenings to rest and recharge. They communicate these boundaries (e.g., “I don’t take calls after 7pm
unless it’s urgent”) and generally stick to them.
- Delegates and trusts their team or colleagues with tasks, rather than trying to do everything alone. By
sharing responsibility and developing others, they prevent their own overload and improve team capacity.
-  Regularly  monitors  their  workload  and  stress  levels,  adjusting  as  needed.  If  things  are  becoming
unsustainable, a grounded person will reprioritize or talk to a supervisor about expectations, rather than
silently drowning. They treat self-management as part of their job.
- Values personal time and well-being as essential to long-term productivity. This might mean actually
taking their vacation days, taking a lunch break away from the desk, or having a firm rule to keep weekends
mostly free for family, hobbies, or rest.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
-  Overcommitment: Continuously  says  “yes”  to  new  tasks,  projects,  or  meeting  requests  without
considering capacity. This could stem from fear of missing opportunities, people-pleasing, or an unrealistic
view that they can “do it all.” The result is an ever-growing pile of responsibilities and chronic overload.
- Blurred lines between work and personal life. An ungrounded worker might check emails compulsively at
the dinner table, work late into most nights, and be mentally at work even during supposed off hours. They
may expect others to keep up this 24/7 pace as well, knowingly or unknowingly pressuring their team to
never unplug.
- Difficulty delegating because of perfectionism or lack of trust. They might insist, “It’s faster if I just do it,”
9


for every little task, or micromanage details even when someone else could handle it. This not only burdens
the leader but can frustrate team members who feel disempowered.
- Neglect of health and personal needs. For example, skipping exercise, not getting enough sleep, or
working while ill, all in service of work demands. They might even wear their excessive workload as a badge
of honor (“I worked 80 hours this week”), equating it to dedication, even as performance quality and
personal well-being decline.
Impact:
- Business/Team: Grounded workload management leads to sustainable productivity. When leaders set a
sane pace and boundaries, employees feel permission to do the same, which keeps everyone healthier and
more focused. Work gets done during reasonable hours with adequate rest — which actually means better
quality work and creativity (as numerous studies show, beyond a certain point, long hours cause errors and
diminishing returns). Additionally, a leader who can effectively delegate and say no when necessary ensures
that the team isn’t overextended on low-value activities; they focus on what truly needs to get done.
Ungrounded habits, conversely, can breed a toxic work culture. If the boss is always emailing at midnight,
people will think that’s expected and burn themselves out trying to keep up. Over time, this churns through
staff, leading to high turnover, or results in increased sick days and mistakes on the job. Business-wise,
while a crunch period is sometimes necessary, a constantly unbalanced workload will reduce innovation
and reliability — tired, overstretched teams simply don’t perform optimally.
- Career: Proper boundary-setting and workload management can actually enhance your career rather than
hinder it. It may seem counterintuitive to some, but by  not taking on more than you can handle, you
preserve the ability to excel at what you do take on. Your work remains high quality, and you build a
reputation as someone who delivers on promises (and who respects others’ time too). Also, showing that
you can delegate and develop others is a key leadership skill that higher-ups look for. On the flip side, if
you’re constantly overcommitted, you’re likely to drop balls or do a mediocre job in at least some areas. This
can tarnish your reputation. In extreme cases, burnout might force you to take a leave of absence or cause
a  noticeable  performance  collapse,  which  can  be  a  setback  professionally.  Furthermore,  a  lack  of
boundaries can lead to resentment; for instance, if you never say no and then fail to meet an unrealistic
expectation, it could be held against you. Knowing your limits and managing them is seen as a sign of
maturity and self-awareness, which are valuable in any career.
- Daily Execution: Day by day, a grounded approach to workload means you have periods of focused work
and periods of genuine rest. You might have a busy morning, but you actually pause for a real lunch break
to recharge. You might put in extra effort during a deadline week, but you also intentionally recover
afterward. This results in more consistent energy levels, and you’re less likely to experience the severe
afternoon crashes or constant stress spikes that come with overwork. In contrast, an ungrounded daily
routine could look like working straight through 12 hours with barely a break, eating at the desk, context-
switching madly because you took on too much. Such days are often marked by exhaustion, irritability, and
eventually diminishing productivity — by hour 10 you’re re-reading the same email three times because you
can’t concentrate. Over time, the ungrounded pattern leads to chronic stress or health issues (headaches,
poor sleep, etc.), which then negatively affect cognitive function and mood, creating a vicious cycle.
Practices & Tips:
-  Learn the power of “no” (or “not now”): Saying no is a classic struggle for many, but it’s vital for
grounding. Remind yourself that every time you say yes to something unimportant, you may be saying no
to something important (including your own well-being). If direct refusal feels hard, practice polite ways to
push back: “I’d love to help, but I’m at capacity right now,” or “I can do that, but it would mean delaying XYZ
– is that okay?” Often, others respect you more for being clear about what’s feasible. As the saying goes,
10


“You can do anything, but not everything.”
- Schedule downtime and stick to it: Treat personal commitments like meetings. Put workouts, reading
time, or family events on your calendar. When it’s in the schedule, you’re more likely to honor it. Some
leaders go as far as scheduling an hour of “thinking time” or a daily walk as a calendar event so that no one
books over it. You can also create an end-of-day routine to symbolically “close” work mode (such as shutting
down your computer and writing a to-do list for tomorrow) which helps you mentally switch to personal
time without lingering guilt.
- Delegate and empower others: Start small if you’re not used to delegating. Choose a task that someone
on your team could conceivably handle, and hand it over with clear instructions and authority to make
certain  decisions.  Realize  that  others  might  do  things  differently  (not  necessarily  worse!).  Over  time,
delegation frees you up for higher-level work and develops your team’s skills. If trust is an issue, consider
why — maybe the team needs training, or maybe you need to let go of perfectionism. Leadership coaches
often work on this mindset: the idea that your success is no longer about doing everything yourself, but
about coordinating a team effort. Grounded leaders take pride in their team’s accomplishments, not just
their own.
- Use healthy rituals to enforce boundaries: For example, have a “shutdown” ritual at day’s end: tidy your
workspace, write tomorrow’s priority list, then physically step away and do something relaxing to signal
work is over. Some people change clothes as if leaving an office, or go for a jog to decompress. In the
morning, a ritual could be not checking email until you’ve oriented yourself for the day (as mentioned
earlier). Another important boundary: vacations. Truly disconnect on vacations by delegating coverage of
urgent matters to someone and setting an out-of-office reply that you won’t be checking email. It can be
hard to let go, but remember that rest will make you far more effective when you return.
Example: Consider two mid-level managers, Ryan and Sofia. Both have high workloads, but they handle
them differently. Ryan (grounded) starts his week by reviewing all his projects and deadlines. He realizes
one deliverable is unrealistic to finish this week, so he proactively talks to his boss about adjusting the
timeline or getting extra help – this is a boundary in action, communicating capacity. He also looks at tasks
he can delegate to his team members as development opportunities for them. Each evening, Ryan leaves
the office (or logs off) by 6:30pm, unless it’s a true emergency or crunch time. He doesn’t respond to non-
urgent emails at night; he’ll deal with them in the morning. As a result, he usually has dinner with his family
and gets a good night’s sleep.  Sofia (ungrounded), however, feels she must prove herself by tackling
everything thrown her way. She rarely says no. If her boss or clients ask for something, she automatically
replies “Sure, I’ll handle it” – even if she’s already swamped. She’s the type to squeeze in one more meeting
at 7pm and stay up past midnight polishing a presentation because she took on too many in one week. She
is often exhausted, and her team has learned that when she delegates, it’s last-minute because she’s
overwhelmed – and by then the team is scrambling too. One Friday, Sofia is running on 5 hours of sleep and
triaging a crisis largely of her own making (she missed a detail in a contract because she was so tired). Ryan,
by contrast, is handling an urgent issue calmly because he has the energy reserves to think clearly, and he’s
confident handing off parts of it to an eager team member. Over time, Ryan’s balanced approach leads to a
reputation as a reliable leader who keeps his team healthy and productive. Sofia’s pattern, unfortunately,
results in her team feeling burnt out and Sofia herself nearing exhaustion, which her upper management
starts to notice in the form of mistakes and turnover. This scenario shows that  working smarter with
boundaries beats simply working more with no limits, every time.

Emotional Resilience
Grounded Behaviors:
- Maintains composure under pressure. This doesn’t mean never feeling stress, but a grounded person can
feel internal anxiety or anger and still choose a measured response. They might take a slow breath or
mentally count to ten before responding to bad news, allowing them to respond with clarity and calmness.
- Acknowledges emotions and setbacks openly, but constructively. For example, a grounded leader might
say to their team, “I know this setback is disappointing – I feel it too – but let’s figure out our next steps.”
They don’t pretend to be superhuman, yet they also don’t let emotions hijack their behavior.
- Bounces back relatively quickly from adversity. After a failure or mistake, once they’ve processed it, they
focus on solutions and lessons learned rather than wallowing. This might manifest as coming in the next
day with a revised plan, or even humor about the situation once appropriate. There’s a sense of optimism or
at least determination to keep moving forward.
- Stays positive and patient through challenges, keeping things in perspective. Grounded resilience often
includes the ability to see the big picture (“This is tough now, but we’ll get through it” or “In five years, this
will just be a story we tell”). This helps not only themselves but also others around them stay motivated.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Easily loses temper or panics. Under stress, an ungrounded person might have a short fuse – snapping at
colleagues, slamming doors, or issuing rash demands. Alternatively, they might visibly panic: freezing up,
spiraling into worst-case thinking out loud, or making erratic decisions driven by fear.
-  Defensive or avoidant when facing criticism or failure: Rather than confront the issue calmly, they
might deny problems (“Everything’s fine!” when it isn’t), shift blame to others, or take feedback as a personal
attack. This is often due to ego or fear overwhelming their ability to objectively consider the information.
- Mood swings that affect the team. For instance, one day they’re exuberantly optimistic (perhaps ignoring
real risks), the next day they’re in despair over a small setback. The inconsistency means the team walks on
eggshells, never sure which version of the person they’ll get.
-  Tends  to  catastrophize  difficulties.  An  ungrounded  mindset  might  interpret  a  moderate  setback  as
“disaster, we’re doomed” and either overreact or become paralyzed by the negativity. They might also dwell
on problems without taking action, as their emotional state traps them in a loop of worry or frustration.
Impact:
- Business/Team: Grounded emotional resilience is crucial for leading teams through tough times. When a
leader remains calm and solution-focused in a crisis, it  anchors the team. As the saying goes, “Calm is
contagious.” Team members are more likely to keep their cool, continue working effectively, and cooperate
to solve problems because they trust that their leader can handle the situation. It builds a culture where
problems are approached as solvable challenges rather than career-ending disasters. Conversely, if a leader
is ungrounded and flies off the handle or falls apart under stress, the team absorbs that panic. People may
start hiding bad news for fear of triggering the leader, which reduces transparency and can let issues fester.
Or they too might become anxious and disengaged, focusing on managing the boss’s moods rather than on
the actual work. In the long run, teams under volatile or pessimistic leadership often have higher turnover
and lower performance, because constant emotional turmoil is draining and discouraging.
- Career: Emotional resilience is a quality that often marks someone for higher leadership. Companies look
for  people  who  can  weather  storms  —  whether  that’s  an  upset  client,  a  failed  project,  or  economic
downturns — without losing effectiveness. If you handle crises with grace and even inspire others during
tough times, you’ll likely be entrusted with bigger responsibilities (perhaps you’ll be the one sent to turn
around a struggling department, for example). Additionally, resilience means you personally can navigate
12


the ups and downs of a long career without burning out or giving up easily. On the other hand, if you gain a
reputation for cracking under pressure or creating drama when things go wrong, it will limit your career.
You might be seen as someone who can’t be put in high-stakes roles. In some cases, a single emotional
blow-up at a critical moment can severely damage a career — e.g., yelling at a client or melting down
publicly in a crisis meeting could mark you as not ready for leadership, or could even lead to dismissal if it’s
severe. In short, resilience (or lack thereof) directly influences how others perceive your leadership capacity.
-  Daily  Execution: Every  workday  brings  small  stresses  —  an  unexpected  problem,  a  colleague’s
disagreement, a change in plans. If you’re emotionally grounded, these bumps stay as minor blips. You can
address them and then return to your baseline fairly quickly. Your day isn’t derailed by a single rude email
or a glitch in a presentation. You might even have a go-to routine like taking a brief walk or doing a 5-
minute meditation to recenter yourself at midday if it’s been chaotic. Your overall productivity remains high
because you manage the emotional noise. For someone ungrounded, even minor stresses accumulate and
throw them off course. A terse client email at 9 AM might put them in a sour mood that causes them to
procrastinate or snap at others for hours. Each day can feel like an emotional rollercoaster, which is
exhausting and makes consistent progress hard. Over time, this can also affect personal health — chronic
stress without coping can lead to anxiety, insomnia, etc., further impeding daily function.
Practices & Tips:
-  Build a mindfulness or meditation habit: There’s strong evidence that mindfulness practices (like
meditation, yoga, breathing exercises) increase emotional regulation. Leaders from tech CEOs to military
commanders have credited meditation with helping them stay calm under fire. Even 10 minutes a day of
sitting quietly and observing your breath can, over time, make you less reactive. If meditation isn’t your
thing, any routine that allows reflection — a morning jog, journaling, prayer — can serve a similar purpose
of centering your mind. The key is consistency; think of it as mental fitness training so that when a stressful
event hits, your mind has the “muscle memory” to stay composed.
-  Reframe setbacks and control self-talk: Resilient people consciously practice looking at challenges
through a productive lens. Psychologist Susan David, for example, talks about “emotional agility” – feeling
your emotions but then choosing your response. If something goes wrong, acknowledge any frustration or
fear internally (“Okay, I’m really disappointed this deal fell through”). Then deliberately shift to a growth
mindset by asking, “What can I learn from this? What’s still in my control? What’s a potential silver lining?” By
focusing on next steps or lessons, you prevent rumination. Another trick: talk to yourself as you would to a
good friend. Instead of harsh self-criticism (“I messed up completely, I’m terrible”), a grounded inner voice
might say, “That didn’t go as expected, but you tried your best. Let’s figure out what to adjust for next time.”
This  kind  of  self-compassion  actually  strengthens  resilience  by  reducing  the  time  you  spend  beating
yourself up.
- Use techniques to regulate in the moment: When you feel a strong emotion at work (anger, fear, etc.),
have a toolbox of healthy coping responses. This could include: stepping away for a few minutes to cool
down, doing a quick breathing exercise (for example, inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6 counts to calm the
heart rate), or even telling a trusted colleague “I’m feeling frustrated, I need a sounding board” instead of
unleashing on the wrong person. Some leaders keep an object on their desk (like a stress ball or a
meaningful photo) that reminds them to stay grounded. The goal is to catch yourself before reacting
impulsively. It’s fine to say in a meeting, “Let’s take a short break and come back with fresh heads,” if
discussion gets heated — that’s a grounded move to maintain composure.
- Build support networks and healthy outlets: Emotional resilience isn’t about bottling everything up; it’s
about processing things in a constructive way. Top executives often have coaches or peer groups where
they can vent confidentially and get perspective. Likewise, having a mentor or even a therapist can provide
a safe space to work through intense feelings and stressors, so you don’t carry them alone. And don’t
13


underestimate personal outlets: hobbies, time with friends/family, or exercise can all serve to replenish your
emotional tank. When you invest in life outside of work, you develop a broader identity and sense of self,
which actually makes work setbacks feel less world-ending. It’s easier to be resilient on the job when your
whole world isn’t only the job.
Example: Imagine a critical software deployment fails unexpectedly. Scenario 1 (Grounded leader): When
the system crashes, the leader’s heart jumps (a natural stress response), but she quickly gathers herself.
She takes a deep breath and asks the team to meet in the war room to troubleshoot. She remains calm and
methodical: “Alright, let’s assess what happened. No blame — we need solutions. What are we seeing in the
error logs?” She acknowledges the stress (“I know this is frustrating, but panicking won’t help. We’ve solved
tough issues before.”) and perhaps injects a bit of confidence (“I trust this team. Let’s focus on the next fix.”).
Because she’s steady, the team stays focused and fixes the issue in a few hours. Afterward, she thanks
everyone and maybe even lightens the mood with, “We’ll laugh about this later – great job staying cool.” The
team ends the night tired but proud of how it was handled. Scenario 2 (Ungrounded leader): At news of
the failure, this leader immediately loses his cool. He might shout, “How could you all let this happen?!”
creating a climate of fear. As the team scrambles, he’s pacing, muttering doom-and-gloom statements like
“If we don’t fix this in an hour, the client will fire us, this is a disaster.” He might oscillate between
micromanaging every tiny decision (“Try this! Did you reboot? Let me see the code!”) and throwing his hands
up (“I can’t deal with this, someone call me when it’s fixed.”). His panic and anger distract the team – some
members are mainly trying not to get yelled at rather than focusing on the technical fix. This chaotic
atmosphere means the problem takes longer to resolve. Even once it’s fixed, the team is demoralized, and
some are quietly updating their résumés. This juxtaposition shows how the same crisis can either be an
opportunity for team cohesion and learning (with a grounded, resilient approach) or a traumatizing fiasco
(with an ungrounded reaction). The grounded leader not only delivers better results under pressure but
also retains the trust and motivation of their team afterward.
Self-Care & Recharge
Grounded Behaviors:
- Prioritizes personal well-being as part of their success strategy. A grounded professional recognizes that
adequate sleep, nutrition, exercise, and downtime are fuel for sustained high performance. They don’t view
self-care as selfish; they see it as essential maintenance. For example, they aim for a healthy sleep schedule
and take breaks during the workday to reset (even a short walk or proper lunch).
- Has hobbies or activities outside of work that they engage in regularly, which help them recharge
mentally. This could be anything from reading, sports, meditation, art, spending time with family, etc. They
make time for these activities and protect that time, because it nourishes their creativity and stress
management.
-  Uses  vacation  days  and  truly  disconnects  when  they  do.  Rather  than  working  through  holidays,  a
grounded person plans vacations or at least staycations to rest. They prepare their team in advance and
trust colleagues to handle things in their absence, avoiding constant check-ins. Upon return, they are
refreshed and often bring new perspectives.
- Practices stress-reduction techniques proactively. Grounded leaders might incorporate small daily habits
like a morning stretching routine, midday breathing exercises, or an evening wind-down ritual (such as
journaling or a technology cut-off an hour before bed) to prevent chronic stress build-up.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Burning the candle at both ends: Frequently sacrifices sleep, proper meals, or any semblance of free
14


time for the sake of work. They might pull all-nighters or consistently sleep far less than recommended,
wearing exhaustion as a badge of honor (“I’m so dedicated, I only slept 4 hours.”).
- Neglects health—perhaps skipping doctor’s appointments, ignoring signs of illness or stress, and not
exercising due to “no time.” Ironically, this often leads to more sick days or decreased productivity, but in
the moment an ungrounded person might think they’re saving time by not resting.
- Has no real breaks. Even on weekends or supposed days off, they’re glued to email or thinking about work
constantly.  Vacations,  if  taken,  are  brief  or  interrupted.  The  concept  of  relaxation  might  even  feel
uncomfortable to them; they’ve gotten so used to a frenetic pace that stopping feels scary or “lazy.”
- Often resorts to unhealthy coping mechanisms for stress because they haven’t made time for healthy
ones. This could include things like excessive caffeine use to combat fatigue, relying on junk food or alcohol
to unwind, or other habits that ultimately worsen their physical and mental state. They may also become
increasingly irritable or apathetic as burnout looms.
Impact:
- Business/Team: When leaders take care of themselves, they create a ripple effect of positive outcomes in
the workplace. They have more energy and clarity to lead effectively, and they model behaviors that
encourage employees to also take care of their health. This can result in lower burnout rates on the team,
higher morale, and a culture that values sustainable productivity over short-term grind. Teams are likely to
be more creative and resilient when everyone’s batteries (including the leader’s) are regularly recharged.
Moreover, a well-rested leader is less prone to making errors in judgment — numerous studies show that
sleep deprivation and chronic stress impair decision-making, creativity, and even ethics. On the flip side, an
ungrounded leader who is perpetually exhausted and stressed can negatively impact the business. They
might make rash decisions or overlook critical details due to fatigue. Their mood might be volatile (as
exhaustion can shorten one’s temper), affecting team dynamics. Employees see the writing on the wall: if
the boss is always fried and never takes a break, they feel guilty taking vacation or signing off at a
reasonable  hour.  Over  time,  this  drives  good  people  away  or  pushes  them  to  burnout  as  well.  The
organization might experience higher healthcare costs, more errors, and lost productivity from burnout-
related turnover or disengagement. In short, a culture of self-neglect is not a competitive advantage; it’s a
liability.
- Career: Grounded self-care supports career longevity and satisfaction. By managing stress and health, you
increase your chances of performing consistently and seizing opportunities over a long career. You’re also
likely  to  develop  a  reputation  as  someone  who’s  stable  and  well-rounded,  not  just  a  work  robot.
Interestingly, many leaders who excel in the long run (decades-long careers) cite balance and personal well-
being as key — they didn’t sprint in year 1 only to collapse in year 5. On the other hand, if you don’t take
care of yourself, your career can derail suddenly. Burnout is a major cause of high performers unexpectedly
quitting or underperforming. If you’re always overworked and drained, you might hit a point where you
simply can’t continue at that pace and take a sabbatical or leave a job abruptly, which can interrupt career
momentum. Health problems might force you out of work temporarily or permanently. Even in day-to-day
career growth, being perennially exhausted can make you less presentable for promotions (imagine you’re
so sleep-deprived you come off as dull or irritable in an important interview for a new role). Moreover, a
career without any balance might lead to regrets; people often realize too late that they missed family time
or personal growth, which can affect their overall sense of fulfillment.
- Daily Execution: Daily, the differences are very tangible. A grounded, well-rested person comes to work
with a clearer mind. They can concentrate longer, handle annoyances with more patience, and think
creatively. When they start feeling tired during the day, they take a short break or grab a healthy snack,
which recharges them for the next task. They likely enjoy their day more and have energy left after work for
personal life. In contrast, an ungrounded person might start the day already tired (after too little sleep),
15


reach for multiple coffees or energy drinks just to function, and run on adrenaline. By early afternoon,
they’re crashing—maybe feeling brain fog or needing sugar—to push through. Small problems feel big
because they’re already irritable. By day’s end, they’re completely spent, maybe even to the point of
cynicism (“I don’t care anymore, I just need to lie down”). They go home with nothing left in the tank,
possibly unable to truly rest because their stress hormones are off balance. Day after day of this not only
hurts productivity (you get diminishing output as the hours pile up) but also makes life less enjoyable.
Practices & Tips:
-  Protect your sleep: Adequate sleep is arguably the most critical self-care component. Aim for the 7-8
hours most adults need. To do this, set a consistent bedtime and pre-bed routine: dim screens and lights,
avoid work emails or stimulating activities right before bed, maybe read something relaxing or practice a
few minutes of breathing exercises. Some leaders treat sleep like an important meeting with themselves —
non-negotiable. Remember, sleep deprivation isn’t heroism; it’s a risk to your cognitive and emotional
functioning.  As  one  wellness  advocate  (Arianna  Huffington)  often  highlights,  being  well-rested  is  a
competitive advantage.
- Regular exercise or movement: You don’t have to be a marathon runner, but find physical activities you
enjoy and schedule them. It could be as simple as a 20-minute walk in the morning, a yoga class twice a
week, or hitting the gym at lunch. Exercise is proven to reduce stress and boost mood. Many top executives
use their workout time to clear their mind or even come up with creative ideas. Treat exercise as part of
your job of taking care of the “asset” — and the asset is you.
- Mindfulness and mental breaks: Incorporate small mental health breaks during your workday. This can
be stepping outside for fresh air, doing a short guided meditation (there are apps that offer 5-minute
sessions), or just consciously eating your lunch without doing work simultaneously. These pauses act like
hitting the reset button on stress. Additionally, some find benefit in practices like journaling gratitude or
thoughts in the morning, which can set a positive tone and help process emotions, indirectly contributing to
less stress carry-over.
- Boundaries for recharge time: We discussed boundaries in workload, and it applies here too. Have some
time that is sacred for you. For example, if you have a hobby (say painting, or playing music, or cooking with
your kids), carve out time each week for it. When you’re doing that activity, fully engage in it and mentally
disconnect from work. It helps to inform colleagues, “I’m unavailable on Wednesday evenings,” or whatever
it is, to create accountability for yourself to keep that time free. If completely unplugging is hard at first,
start with partial measures: maybe you stop checking email after 8pm as a rule, or you commit to one
screen-free day a week. Over time, you’ll likely find that the world doesn’t fall apart when you’re not
constantly on, and you’ll cherish those recharge moments. 
Example: Let’s  compare  two  consultants,  Jessica and  Leo,  who  both  have  demanding  jobs.  Jessica
(grounded in self-care) makes it a habit to wake up at 6:30 am and do a short meditation or stretching
routine. She goes to bed by 11 pm most nights, understanding that a full night’s sleep makes her far
sharper. During her workday, she actually takes a lunch break to eat a healthy meal and maybe take a quick
walk around the block to clear her head. On a busy afternoon, when she feels her concentration dipping,
she’ll step away from her desk for five minutes to breathe deeply or chat briefly with a colleague, then
return refreshed. She has a rule to keep Sundays free from work to spend time with her family or hobbies,
knowing that day off gives her something to look forward to and prevents burnout. Leo (ungrounded in
self-care) has a very different pattern. He often stays up past 1 am working or unwinding with TV, then
drags himself out of bed groggy. He hits the snooze button multiple times, skipping breakfast, and rushes
to start work. He stays glued to his computer for hours, maybe grabbing coffee after coffee and a pastry to
keep going. Lunch is a quick sandwich eaten at the desk while he’s on a conference call. He hasn’t exercised
16


in weeks because “there’s just no time.” By late afternoon, he’s frazzled and exhausted, making simple
mistakes in his calculations that he then has to fix in the evening. He promised himself to take Saturday off,
but when it comes, he ends up logging in because he feels behind—and besides, he’s lost touch with
hobbies and mostly feels too tired to do much else. Over time, Jessica’s approach keeps her energetic and
mentally clear; her clients notice her creativity and poise and give glowing feedback. Leo, unfortunately,
begins to show signs of burnout: he’s often fatigued, less creative in problem-solving, and one day he snaps
at a coworker (something he never used to do). Eventually, he has to take a stress leave on doctor’s orders,
missing out on a promotion cycle. The contrast is clear: Jessica’s grounded commitment to self-care not only
makes  her  happier  and  healthier  but  directly  supports  her  professional  success,  whereas  Leo’s
unsustainable habits catch up with him and hinder his career.
Values & Ethical Alignment
Grounded Behaviors:
- Has a well-defined set of  core values (such as honesty, fairness, excellence, compassion, etc.) and
consistently uses them as a guide for decisions and behavior. This means if integrity is a core value, a
grounded leader won’t lie to make a sale; if respect is a value, they consistently treat everyone from the CEO
to the janitor with respect.
-  Walks  the  talk: There  is  alignment  between  what  they  publicly  espouse  (company  mission,  team
principles, personal ethics) and what they actually do. For instance, if a leader preaches work-life balance as
a value, they will demonstrate it by not sending 2am emails or by taking their own vacation time. This
consistency builds credibility.
- Willing to take a stand based on principles, even when it’s hard. Grounded individuals don’t compromise
their ethics for short-term benefit. They might turn down a lucrative business deal if it conflicts with their
company’s values or their personal morals. They prefer to look at themselves in the mirror and be at peace
with their choices.
- Derives a sense of purpose from living their values, which gives them inner strength. Knowing that their
career and daily work contribute to something meaningful (beyond just profit or personal gain) keeps them
grounded during tough decisions. They often talk about the “why” behind their work, inspiring others with a
mission or higher principle.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Unclear or flexible morals: May not have taken the time to identify what their core values are, resulting in
inconsistency. They might go with the flow of what others or the industry suggest, even if it conflicts with
things they deep down care about. Or they claim certain values but drop them when inconvenient (for
example, touting quality but shipping a subpar product to meet a deadline).
- The “say-do” gap: These individuals might engage in virtue signaling (saying all the right things about
ethics or company values in public), but employees notice that in practice they cut corners or treat people in
ways that don’t match those words. This erodes trust quickly, as people sense the inauthenticity.
- Prioritizes short-term gains or appeasing others over doing the right thing. This could manifest as turning
a blind eye to an ethical issue because addressing it is uncomfortable or might slow things down. For
instance, not speaking up if they see a teammate cheating on an expense report, because they don’t want
conflict.  Or  as  a  leader,  making  a  decision  that  boosts  quarterly  numbers  but  harms  customers  or
employees, rationalizing it away.
- May experience an inner sense of conflict or lack of fulfillment, even if externally successful, because they
aren’t aligned with any deeper purpose. This can sometimes show up as sudden career moves that seem
17


erratic (“Why did they quit that high-paying job out of the blue?”) — often the person was running on
someone else’s values (like just chasing money or prestige) and hit a wall of dissatisfaction.
Impact:
-  Business/Team: Grounded, values-driven leadership fosters trust and loyalty. Employees tend to rally
behind leaders who clearly stand for something positive and demonstrate integrity. It creates a culture
where ethical behavior is the norm—people know that “how” results are achieved matters, not just the
results themselves. This can save a company from ethical scandals and also attract customers and partners
who want to associate with a principled organization. Over time, such companies often enjoy strong
reputations, brand loyalty, and lower risk because they’re not playing fast and loose with rules or ethics.
Ungrounded leadership in terms of values can be dangerous. If workers see a leader compromise ethics
when under pressure, they will assume it’s acceptable for them to do so too. This might lead to team
members cutting corners, hiding information, or competing ruthlessly in harmful ways. It also kills morale
among those who do value integrity—talented staff who feel icky about the culture may leave. In extreme
cases, lack of alignment with values can lead to public scandals (fraud, discrimination cases, etc.) that
severely impact the business’s viability. Internally, even without scandal, a values-deficient environment
often results in siloed, untrusting teams and a “every person for themselves” mentality.
- Career: A strong personal brand of integrity and authenticity is an incredible career asset. People who are
grounded in their values often become trusted advisors, sought-after leaders, or successful entrepreneurs
because  others  know  they  can  be  counted  on  to  do  the  right  thing.  They  build  deep  professional
relationships – mentors, peers, and team members who will go the extra mile for them – precisely because
of that trust. Additionally, when your work aligns with your values, you tend to be more motivated and
resilient, which can propel your success. For ungrounded individuals, any gains achieved by cutting ethical
corners are often short-lived. If word gets out that you compromise on ethics or don’t stand for anything, it
can seriously hamper career advancement. Colleagues might be wary of partnering with you, and upper
management  might  not  want  to  promote  someone  who  could  tarnish  the  company’s  integrity.  Also,
personally, if you spend years in a job or career that conflicts with your values (say, working for a company
whose mission you don’t believe in, or in a role that requires actions you find dubious), it can lead to
burnout  or  a  crisis  of  conscience.  Many  mid-career  shifts  happen  because  people  realize  they  were
ungrounded in their choices early on and want to realign with what matters to them.
- Daily Execution: On a daily basis, being grounded in values simplifies many decisions and reduces stress.
You have a clear internal compass. For example, if honesty is a core value, you won’t agonize over whether
to admit a mistake – you’ll just do it, because that’s who you are. This clarity can save time and mental
energy; you’re not constantly second-guessing or feeling guilt about decisions. It also gives a sense of self-
confidence and peace – you can end the day knowing you stayed true to yourself. For an ungrounded
person, daily life can involve a lot of moral gray zones and second-guessing. They might feel uneasy about
how they handled a situation (like “Hmm, that client asked for a slightly misleading statement and I went
along; was that okay? My boss expects it, so I guess so…”), which creates internal tension. They might also
get  caught  in  more  office  politics  or  ethical  dilemmas  because  they  lack  clear  boundaries,  causing
additional anxiety. Over time, those small daily compromises or confusions accumulate, potentially leading
to significant regret or a feeling of “losing oneself” in the job.
Practices & Tips:
- Clarify your values: It’s worth taking time to explicitly identify your top values. You can find lists of values
(e.g., integrity, innovation, compassion, etc.) and choose a handful that resonate most. A tip from Brené
Brown, a leadership thought leader, is to narrow it down to just two core values that truly define you. The
exercise forces you to prioritize what’s non-negotiable. Once you have those, reflect on what behaviors
18


exemplify those values. For instance, if one of your core values is “respect,” a behavior might be “hearing
out even junior team members’ opinions fully” or “avoiding gossip.” Writing these down and perhaps
sharing them with your team can reinforce your commitment and keep you accountable.
- Use values as a filter for decisions: When facing a tough decision, consciously run it through the filter of
your values. Ask, “Does this choice align with my values and our organizational values?” For example, if
family is a personal value and you’re weighing a new job offer that pays more but will severely reduce family
time, the values check might guide you to decline or negotiate terms. Or if transparency is a stated team
value and a project issue arises, a values-driven approach would be to inform stakeholders early rather than
hide it. This habit builds integrity. It can be helpful to involve your team in these considerations too (“How
can we solve this in a way consistent with our values of customer care and quality?”).
- Create accountability mechanisms: It’s one thing to intend to live your values, another to actually do it
under pressure. Find ways to hold yourself to your ethical standards. This could involve mentorship or peer
accountability (having someone you trust who can call you out if you start to stray). Some leaders establish
a personal “ethics check” process for big decisions, perhaps consulting an ethics committee or simply
sleeping on the decision overnight to see if it still feels right in the morning. In team settings, fostering a
culture where anyone can voice concerns (“speak-up culture”) helps ensure that if something doesn’t feel
ethically right, it’s addressed.
- Align career moves with your values: This is more strategic, but extremely important. Periodically assess
if your current role or company is in sync with what you care about. If not, consider either how you can
effect change or whether a move is needed. Many people find higher satisfaction when they work for
organizations that share their values (for example, someone who values sustainability might thrive at a
clean-energy company). In interviews or evaluations, ask questions about company culture and ethical
practices. Grounded professionals often choose the slightly less flashy offer from a company whose culture
they admire over a big paycheck at a ethically ambiguous enterprise, and in the long run, that tends to pay
off in personal happiness (and often career success, since you’ll do better work when you believe in it).
Example: Let’s look at two executives faced with an ethical dilemma. Their company is just shy of hitting a
big quarterly target, and there’s pressure to  “make the numbers look good.” Executive 1 (grounded in
values): He values honesty and transparency highly. When an accountant suggests they could recognize
revenue a bit early (a gray area maneuver) to hit the target, Executive 1 immediately feels that pit in his
stomach – a sign this conflicts with his principles. He thanks the accountant for the idea but says, “No, we’re
not going to play with the numbers. We’ll report things as they are. And we’ll openly explain to investors
why we fell short and how we’ll correct course.” He also decides to inform the board preemptively of the
shortfall, taking accountability. This approach is difficult in the moment (nobody likes reporting a miss), but
he knows it’s right and that maintaining integrity will serve the company’s reputation long-term. Executive
2 (ungrounded in values): She’s driven by hitting targets above all else — perhaps her bonus or ego is tied
to it. She’s not particularly reflective about values, mostly thinking “everyone in the industry does stuff like
this.” So when a similar accounting trick is suggested, she goes along without much hesitation. They
manage to scrape over the finish line on paper. However, over the next couple of quarters, these aggressive
tactics escalate; eventually, some practices cross fully into unethical territory, and the company has to
restate earnings when it’s discovered, causing a scandal. Executive 2 finds herself under intense scrutiny,
her credibility damaged. Meanwhile, Executive 1, though he reported a tough quarter, earned respect from
his board and team for his candor and principles. In another scenario on a personal career level: imagine
being offered a job at a company known for cutthroat practices that conflict with your values. A grounded
professional might turn it down, even if it’s a prestigious role, choosing instead a path that aligns better
with their ethical standards. An ungrounded person might take it for the title or money and later find
themselves miserable or ethically compromised. These examples underscore that staying true to core
19


values might have short-term costs or discomforts, but it builds a foundation of trust and self-respect that
yields long-term benefits. Losing one’s grounding in values, conversely, can lead to dire consequences
professionally and personally.
Adaptability & Change Management
Grounded Behaviors:
- Faces change with a  calm, open mindset. A grounded leader doesn’t panic in the face of volatility or
uncertainty. Instead, they acknowledge the change and approach it with curiosity (“What does this change
mean? How can we adapt?”). Their demeanor remains steady, which can be reassuring to others.
- Maintains clarity on core principles and goals during change, but is flexible on the details. This means they
know what must remain constant (e.g., our mission or quality standards) and what can be adjusted (e.g.,
strategy, processes). They can pivot strategy when needed, without feeling like everything is up in the air.
-  Communicates  proactively  and  empathetically  through  change.  They  understand  people  might  feel
anxious, so they share information as transparently as possible, articulate the reasons behind changes, and
listen to concerns. They also model optimism and confidence that the team can navigate the transition,
which helps others embrace it.
-  Has  a  learning-oriented  attitude.  Grounded  adaptability  often  includes  treating  new  situations  as
opportunities to learn rather than threats to fear. These individuals ask for feedback, seek new knowledge
or skills when faced with a change (for example, taking a quick course on a new technology affecting their
industry), and encourage the team to experiment and iterate rather than cling to old ways that aren’t
working.
Ungrounded Behaviors:
- Reacts to change with  fear or denial. An ungrounded person might resist even necessary changes,
sticking stubbornly to “how we’ve always done it” because it feels safe. Alternatively, they might have the
opposite reaction: knee-jerk overreaction. For instance, at the first sign of market downturn, they might
slash budgets across the board without analysis, or if a new competitor arises, they scramble to imitate
without a plan.
- Communicates poorly in times of change. They might either keep people in the dark (perhaps out of their
own uncertainty or hope it will blow over) or send mixed messages because their own stance shifts
frequently. This leaves teams confused or rife with rumors.
- Allows personal anxiety to translate into erratic leadership. One week they might be implementing one
drastic change, the next week reversing it, because they’re chasing external inputs without an internal
compass. Or they might freeze and do nothing, hoping problems solve themselves, which can be just as
damaging if decisive action is needed. In short, there’s a lack of consistent, rational guidance.
- Tends to view change in a catastrophic light. Rather than “this is difficult but we’ll find a way,” the mindset
might be “this is impossible, everything is ruined.” This defeatist attitude can become a self-fulfilling
prophecy,  as  it  demotivates  efforts  to  adapt.  They  might  also  take  changes  personally  (“Why  is  this
happening to me?”) rather than seeing the bigger picture, which can cloud judgment.
Impact:
- Business/Team: In today’s fast-moving world, adaptability is often the difference between companies (or
teams) that thrive and those that fail. A grounded approach to change management means the team has a
stable force to rally around. When employees see their leader staying calm, explaining the situation, and
laying out a plan, they’re more likely to trust the process and put in the effort to pivot effectively. This can
lead to successful innovations, smoother transitions (like adopting new tools or reorganizing teams), and
20


even competitive advantage because the organization responds to external changes in a thoughtful way.
Moreover, a grounded leader typically engages people in the change (“What ideas do you have? Here’s how
your role might evolve...”), which increases buy-in. Conversely, ungrounded handling of change can wreak
havoc. If the leader is freaking out or in hiding, employees may either panic or disengage. The rumor mill
might go wild (“Are we going under? Should I be job searching?”). Poorly thought-out changes (or flip-
flopping strategies) can lead to project failures, wasted resources, and loss of customer confidence. A team
that experiences that whiplash might start resisting any new initiative (“Last time we changed direction on a
whim, it was a disaster”). Ultimately, companies led in an ungrounded way through change can lose market
position or implode, not necessarily because the change was inherently insurmountable, but because it was
managed so haphazardly that the organization couldn’t cope.
-  Career: Adaptability is a prized trait in professionals. If you demonstrate that you can not only accept
changes (new policies, industry shifts, role changes) but actually turn them into opportunities, you become
very valuable. People who are grounded and adaptable often end up leading special projects or being
promoted to roles that require transforming something (since they’ve shown they won’t be paralyzed by the
unknown). They’re also more likely to navigate their own career transitions effectively — whether that’s
moving to a new industry or taking on a different type of role — because they approach it methodically and
positively. Those who are ungrounded with change may find their careers stagnate or derail. For example,
someone who resists every change (“I refuse to learn that new system; the old one works fine”) might be
passed over or even let go if the job evolves beyond them. Or if they handle a major change poorly (say,
they were in charge of a reorganization that went badly due to their chaotic approach), that can mar their
track record. On a personal level, being unadaptable can mean you miss out on growth opportunities — you
might stay in a shrinking field too long out of fear to pivot, or you burn bridges when things change at a
company because you didn’t handle it gracefully.
- Daily Execution: In times of stability, daily work might not differ much between an adaptable person and
a not-so-adaptable one. But the moment something shifts — a new software to use, a sudden change in
project scope, a team member leaving — the differences show. A grounded, adaptable person will adjust
their plan for the day pragmatically. They might reprioritize tasks, seek information about the new situation,
and keep working with relatively steady nerves. An ungrounded person might spend half the day stressing
or complaining about the change (“I can’t believe they’re making us use this new tool, this is ridiculous!”),
which is essentially wasted time. They might also inadvertently resist by not adjusting their tasks (ignoring
the new priority and sticking to their old plan). Over time, one can adapt to small changes daily and stay
productive, whereas the other accumulates frustration and falls behind whenever something doesn’t go
according to the original plan.
Practices & Tips:
- Stay informed and anticipate change: Grounding yourself in knowledge can reduce fear. If your industry
is volatile, keep abreast of trends so changes don’t catch you completely off-guard. When you sense a
change coming (like a merger, a market shift, a new boss, etc.), do some research or scenario planning. Ask
“What’s the worst that could happen? How would I respond?” Having even a rough plan for various
possibilities can make you feel more prepared and less reactive if one of those scenarios happens. It’s like
having an umbrella on a cloudy day — you might not need it, but knowing it’s there is calming.
- Mindfulness in the face of uncertainty: When change hits, your physiological reaction might be anxiety.
Grounding techniques can help keep your mind from racing to worst-case scenarios. This could be deep
breathing, as mentioned before, or a quick meditation focusing on the present moment (reminding yourself
that in this very moment, you are okay, which is often true even if the future is uncertain). Some leaders
practice “box breathing” (used by Navy SEALs in stressful situations: inhale 4 counts, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4)
to stay clear-headed in crisis. A calm mind will make better adaptive decisions.

- Embrace a problem-solving mindset: Shift from “Oh no, what now?” to “Alright, given this new reality,
what are our options?” Encourage brainstorming and input from others when appropriate – engaging with
the  change  actively  can  shift  you  out  of  fear  into  creativity.  Also,  break  big  changes  into  smaller,
manageable steps. For example, if your company is restructuring your department, focus on immediate
steps like “Today I will clarify my new responsibilities and set up one-on-ones with my new team members,”
rather than being overwhelmed by the entire transformation at once. This creates a sense of progress and
control.
-  Communicate, communicate, communicate: Especially if you’re a leader, during change you almost
cannot over-communicate. Share updates regularly, even if it’s “We don’t have all the answers yet, but here’s
what we know and what we’re working on.” Acknowledge people’s concerns (“I know this shift to a new
project management tool is sudden, and some of you have never used it – it’s okay to feel uneasy. We’ll
provide training and help each other out.”). Also important: listen. Create channels for folks to ask questions
or express worries. Sometimes just being heard by leadership makes people more adaptable because they
feel respected and involved rather than victims of change. If you’re an individual contributor not in control
of the change, communicating is still key – ask your manager questions to clarify, offer your perspective or
ideas on how to adapt, and stay connected with peers (often, solving it together or even commiserating a
bit can make change feel more manageable than isolating yourself).
Example: Let’s take the scenario of a company suddenly moving to a full remote-work model (a change
many  experienced).  Adaptable,  grounded  manager: She  might  initially  feel  apprehensive,  but  she
approaches it step by step. Day 1, she gathers her team on a video call: “This is a big change. Let’s talk
about how we’ll stay connected and effective. What challenges do you anticipate? What tools do we need?”
She sets up a shared document where everyone can suggest ideas for remote collaboration norms. She
remains upbeat, saying things like, “We’ll experiment and learn as we go. I’m confident we can make this
work.” When small issues arise (like a communication mix-up), she addresses them calmly (“Okay, that didn’t
work, let’s try a different approach tomorrow”). Over a few weeks, the team finds its rhythm and even
discovers some benefits to remote work (maybe more flexibility). Ungrounded manager: Upon hearing the
remote-work directive, he reacts with outward frustration or panic: “This is going to ruin everything! How
are we supposed to do our jobs like this?” He doesn’t provide much guidance or reassurance to his team
because he’s mired in his own discomfort. Perhaps he avoids team check-ins out of uncertainty, or swings to
micromanaging via constant messages because he doesn’t trust the new setup. The team feels this anxiety
and lack of clear direction; some start to disengage, unsure how to proceed. Miscommunications multiply.
Instead of proactively solving them, the manager might either blame the change (“See, remote doesn’t
work!”) or flip-flop on policies (“No, everyone come to a call every single morning at 8 sharp because I need
to see you working” one week, then radio silence the next). The adaptable manager’s team, after initial
bumps, continues to meet goals and feel supported, whereas the ungrounded manager’s team experiences
declining performance and morale due to chaotic leadership in the new environment. Another quick
example on a personal career level: imagine your role is being redefined and some responsibilities are
changing. An adaptable person would likely proactively learn the new skills required and see it as an
opportunity to grow (“Great, I’ll get to add this new tool to my repertoire”). An ungrounded person might
cling only to the old responsibilities and do the bare minimum on new tasks, missing the chance to shine in
the evolved role and possibly putting their job at risk if they can’t adjust. These scenarios highlight that
grounded adaptability not only navigates change more successfully but can turn change into a stepping
stone for improvement, whereas ungrounded reactions make change far more painful and damaging than
it needs to be.
