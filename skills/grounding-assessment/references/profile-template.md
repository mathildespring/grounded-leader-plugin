# Grounding Assessment Profile Template

**When to read this:** Reference this template when creating a grounded leader profile for a participant. It shows the expected structure and format.

---

✅ What to Include in the Downloadable Sheet:

Professional Context	

Brief summary of the participant’s current role, industry context, and personal/professional intentions (from the opening prompt). Use this to ground interpretations in real leadership dynamics and lived priorities.

Raw Reflections (verbatim only)	

Verbatim text of all 7 participant reflections (uncut), organized by question theme: 

1.	Overwhelm Story 

2.	Flow Story 

3.	Colleague Relationships 

4.	Boundaries & Energy Story 

5.	Decision-Making Story 

6.	Adaptability & Change Story

7.	Values Alignment Story 

(All responses stored uncut to preserve texture for future AI analysis.)

Grounding Strengths	

3 behaviors or tendencies where the participant consistently or naturally grounds (e.g. “pauses when they feel anxiety rising”). Include situational examples and context where this shows up (e.g., in creative work, in relationships). Use vivid, situational language.

Blocks or Blind Spots	

3 patterns where the participant ungrounds, is unaware that they are not grounded, or struggles to come back to a centered, grounded state. May be implied through tone, omission, or contradiction 

Latent Grounding Potential	

3 emerging capacities that the participant seems ready to strengthen - subtle signs of what’s possible.

Hidden Patterns & Unspoken Tendencies	

3–5 observations based on timing, contradictions, omissions, tone, or gaps. These should reflect what the participant didn’t say or inconsistencies across their answers. Use framing like: “Tends to emphasize logic in high-stakes contexts under stress, forgetting other contexts” or “Grounds naturally in relationships but not in decision-making.”

Grounding Category Map (by Dimension) 

Scoring or descriptive grid that maps how their grounding currently shows up across the 9 categories (e.g., Team Interaction & Collaboration, Digital Communication, Task Focus & Execution, Prioritization & Strategic Alignment, Workload & Boundaries, Emotional Resilience, etc.) using RAG (Red/Amber/Green). Note if: strong, neutral and weak areas.

Grounding Across Levels

Daily Grounding:
(1–2 bullets on how grounding shows up in day-to-day work)

Career Grounding:
(1–2 bullets on recurring patterns or longer-term impact)

Strategic Grounding:
(1–2 bullets on how grounding appears in high-stakes or future-shaping moments)

Cross-Level Insight:
(1–2 sentences connecting the three)

Recommended Practices (Personalized)	

3 tailored grounding practices — drawn from “Practices Reference Guide” — matched to the participant’s blind spots and style. Include why each one is useful for them.

Coachable Opportunities & Questions to Explore	

3 open-ended prompts or insights that could guide deeper reflection later with an AI coach. (e.g. “What part of your current leadership style would benefit most from deeper presence?” or “How do you know the difference between numbing out and truly grounding?”)
