# Grounded Leader — Grounding Assessment

Map your grounding patterns across 9 leadership dimensions through a reflective, story-based coaching conversation.

## What it does

This plugin guides you through a deep self-assessment that reveals how grounding shows up in your professional life — where you're steady and present, where you lose your footing, and what practices can help you lead from a more centered place.

You'll reflect on 7 real stories from your work life. The skill then generates a comprehensive Grounded Leader Profile including your strengths, blind spots, hidden patterns, and personalized mindfulness practices.

## The 9 Grounding Dimensions

1. Team Interaction & Collaboration
2. Digital Communication & Notifications
3. Task Focus & Execution
4. Prioritization & Strategic Alignment
5. Workload & Boundaries
6. Emotional Resilience
7. Self-Care & Recharge
8. Values & Ethical Alignment
9. Adaptability & Change

## How to use

Install the plugin, start a new conversation, and say something like:

- "I'd like to do my grounding assessment"
- "Map my grounding profile"
- "Help me understand my grounding patterns as a leader"

The skill will guide you through the full coaching conversation from there.
